Go to Our World In Data (OWID). In this exercise you will explore differences between two countries, the
US and India, which are classified as “high” income and “lower-middle” income, respectively, by the World
Bank.
1. Provide plots for India and the US (both countries on one plot, select “linear” for the y axis) for the
following data series:
• GDP per capita (PPP), Source: Maddison. Plot the data from 1918 to 2018.
• Life expectancy, Source: Riley (2005), Clio Infra (2015), and UN Population Division (2019).
Plot the data from 1921 to 2021.
